 If I Fran The Con
 =====================
 
 
 A Fangame for Glasgow Worldcon 2024 and If I Ran the ~~Zoo~~ Con, in Ink
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Inspired by John Coxon's Discord-mediated playthrough of "If I Ran the ~~Zoo~~ Con", in which the players developed a certain f~~r~~andom (and anti-f~~r~~andom) towards Fran Frasier, beleaguered social-media person, despite her only actually being in one scenario in the game. This ended up with stickers being produced so congoers could signal their membership of the *Secret Order of Frandom*.

Obviously, the next step was to write a game from Fran's perspective.

(and maybe with a bit of influence from Mike Moorcock, if you play more than once ;)
